	description = A small alkaline fuel cell with enough oxygen and hydrogen to last 6 hours under full load (3EC/s). A Kerbal in a command pod uses about 127.5 EC/hour with TAC Life Support, thus the inbuilt resources are enough for over 500 hours at that consumption rate. ATTENTION: If activated, this fuel cell only starts production if the EC level falls below 10% of your vessels total EC capacity!
